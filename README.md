# Discord-Jellyfish-Utility
_A JDA Discord bot that does interesting things sometimes._

I've written a bot as a utility for _The Jellyfish_'s Discord server. This bot is designed to be contributed to.

To add a command, create a new enum constant in `Registry.java`, with the command name, usage, and description, as well as a listener (you can use `StandardCommandListener`, or subclass `ListenerAdapter`).

If you would like to run this bot, I can give you the token. This bot will not work without it.
